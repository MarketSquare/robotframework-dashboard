## 🎯 Overview

Robot Framework Dashboard is a tool for [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) that provides insight of your test results across multiple runs. The tool makes use of the built in Robot Framework [Result Visitor API](https://robot-framework.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_modules/robot/result/visitor.html) to analyse output.xml files, stores these in a simple sqlite3 database and finally creates a HTML dashboard that makes use of [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) and [Datatables](https://datatables.net/) for the graphs and tables and makes use of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling. Additionally [GridStack](https://gridstackjs.com/) is used for the interactive layout grids.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
Install Robot Framework 6.0 or higher (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install robotframework
```
Install Robot Framework Dashboard:
```bash
pip install robotframework-dashboard
```
Install Robot Framework Dashboard with Server:
```bash
pip install robotframework-dashboard[server]
pip install robotframework-dashboard[all]
```

### Basic Usage

**Example 1 — Add a single output file and generate a dashboard:**
```bash
robotdashboard -o output.xml
```
This adds `output.xml` to the default database (`robot_results.db`) and generates a self-contained HTML dashboard file you can open directly in any browser.

**Example 2 — Add multiple output files with a custom database and dashboard name:**
```bash
robotdashboard -o output1.xml -o output2.xml -d my_results.db -n my_dashboard.html
```
This processes two output XML files, stores results in `my_results.db`, and writes the dashboard to `my_dashboard.html`.

For all available CLI options see the [Basic CLI docs](https://marketsquare.github.io/robotframework-dashboard/basic-command-line-interface-cli.html) and [Advanced CLI & Examples](https://marketsquare.github.io/robotframework-dashboard/advanced-cli-examples.html).
