# Installation & Version Info

Learn how to install RobotFramework Dashboard and check compatibility requirements. This page explains installation steps, supported versions, and important system notes.

## Installation

Before installing the dashboard, ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed on your system. You also need **Robot Framework 6.0 or higher**.

### Install Robot Framework
If Robot Framework is not already installed, run:

```bash
pip install robotframework>=6.0
```

### Install Robot Framework Dashboard
Install the dashboard using pip:

```bash
pip install robotframework-dashboard
```

### Install Robot Framework Dashboard Server

The server can be installed separately and is not installed by default.
This has been done to reduce dependencies that are required only for the server like `fastapi` and `uvicorn`.

Install Robot Framework Dashboard with Server:
```bash
pip install robotframework-dashboard[server]
pip install robotframework-dashboard[all]
```

> **Note:** `[server]` and `[all]` currently install the same extras (fastapi-offline, uvicorn, python-multipart). Use either one.

### Dependencies
This will automatically install the required dependencies:
- robotframework>=6.0 – the core testing framework
- fastapi>=0.115.11 – the web framework used for the dashboard server
- uvicorn>=0.33.0 – the ASGI server to run the dashboard

Note: FastAPI and Uvicorn are only needed if you intend to run the dashboard web server.

## Version Details

### Supported Robot Framework Versions
The Robot Framework Dashboard has been tested with the following Robot Framework versions:
6.0, 6.0.1, 6.0.2, 6.1, 6.1.1, 7.0, 7.0.1, 7.1, 7.1.1, 7.2, 7.2.1, 7.2.2, 7.3, 7.3.1

### Compatibility notes:
- When running robotdashboard with Robot Framework 6.x, output files generated by Robot 7.x will have no duration fields when processed. This is due to changes in the Result Visitor model.
- When running robotdashboard with Robot Framework 7.x, output files generated by any version above 6.x should be processed correctly.

### Quick Verification
To verify the installation:

```bash
robot --version
robotdashboard --help
```
This ensures both Robot Framework and the dashboard are installed correctly and are in your PATH.

## Upgrading & Database Migration

When upgrading RobotDashboard to a newer version, your existing SQLite database is **automatically migrated**. The tool detects older schemas by checking table column counts and adds any missing columns.

The following schema changes are applied automatically:

| Version | Change |
|---------|--------|
| v0.4.3 | Added `tags` column to tests table |
| v0.6.0 | Added `run_alias` column to all tables |
| v0.8.1 | Added `path` column to runs table |
| v0.8.4 | Added `id` column to suites and tests tables |
| v1.0.0 | Added `metadata` column to runs table |
| v1.2.0 | Added `owner` column to keywords table |
| v1.3.0 | Added `project_version` column to runs table |

No manual intervention is required — simply run `robotdashboard` with your existing database and it will be upgraded in place. Existing data is preserved.

::: warning Upgrade Considerations
- **Backup first** — once migrated to a newer schema, the database may not be compatible with older versions of RobotDashboard.
- **New columns are empty for existing records** — when new columns are added during migration, they will have empty values for runs that were already in the database. Features that depend on these columns (e.g., metadata filtering, project versioning, keyword library names) will not work for those older runs until they are re-processed.
- **Re-adding runs populates new columns** — to enable new features for older runs, remove them from the database and re-add their `output.xml` files. This will populate all columns with the correct data.
